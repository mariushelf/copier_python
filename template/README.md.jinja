## Releasing

Releases are managed via [python-semantic-release](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/).
Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to trigger automatic version bumps.

To create a release, trigger the "Release" workflow manually from GitHub Actions.
This will create a draft release in GitHub.
When the draft release is published, the package is automatically uploaded to PyPI.
